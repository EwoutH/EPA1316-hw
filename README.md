# EPA1316-hw
A repository to share labs and homework implementations for the Introduction to Urban Data Science course at the Delft University of Technology.

## Contributing
Do you have a nice implementation?
1. _Fork_ the repository using the Fork button in the top right.
2. Clone your fork using Git (using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) makes this easier).
3. Create a new branch and move your Jupyter notebook file to the right folder (`hw-01` for example). Make sure to rename your notebook to start with your (nick)name (for example `ewouth-hw-01.ipynb`).
4. Commit the changes your made (the new file) to your branch. Make sure to add a nice description.
5. Open a [Pull request](https://github.com/EwoutH/EPA1316-hw/pulls) to add your version to the central GitHub repository. Give a short motivation if you like. Someone will take a look at it and merge it when ready.

Policies for merging proposed solutions into a single notebook will be considered later.

## New to Git(Hub)?
The GitHub [Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) is a good place to get started. For more about Git, see the GitHub [Git Handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/).

Installing [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) can be very useful.
